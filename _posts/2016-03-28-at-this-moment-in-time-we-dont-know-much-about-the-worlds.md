# Today, we know more about the Planet Mars than about 70% of our Planet Earth - the worlds ocean

Ocean data and insights have been been gathered for decades. But the collected information is only accessible to less than 1% of the worlds population.

* Most of you in need for ocean insights, cannot access it. 
* Most of you with access, cannot really make sense out of it because it still only represents a small fraction of the needed ocean picture. 
* The rest of the information is locked in various, unaccessible places for you.
