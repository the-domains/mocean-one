# Tomorrow you can have access to all information about the worlds ocean

You understand climate change implications and its effects on extreme weather events. It empowers you to develop predictive and condition based lifesaving solutions for all of us.

You understand the geological, meteorological and ecological mechanisms. It empowers you to develop solutions that protect and nurture the marine environment. 

You understand how to optimise energy production in - and resource extraction from the ocean. It empowers you to develop new solutions and markets providing food, materials, energy, medicine, etc. from oceans whilst land based resources are depleting.

All of us have access to knowledge and insights about 70% of Planet Earth. We are empowered to protect the people, the environment and to develop solutions that provide needed resources. 

This is for us, our children and future generations to come.
