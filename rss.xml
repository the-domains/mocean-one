            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Calling Mocean One</h1><p>At this moment in time, we don´t know much about the worlds ocean. We know that a lot of ocean knowledge and insight has been gathered for many years and is gathered right now. But this information is only accessible for about 1% of the worlds population. Many of you in need, cannot access it. Many of you with access, cannot make sense of it because it only represents a fraction of the needed ocean picture. The rest of the information is locked in various, unaccessible places for you. IMAGINE TOMORROW you would have access to all information about the worlds ocean = 70% of Planet Earth… 1. You now better understand climate change implications and its effects on extreme weather events. It empowers you to develop predictive and condition based lifesaving solutions for all of us. 2. You now better understand the geological, meteorological and ecological mechanisms. It empowers you to develop solutions that protect and nurture the marine environment. 3. You now better understand how to optimise energy production in - and resource extraction from the ocean. It empowers you to develop new solutions and markets providing food, materials, energy, medicine, etc. from oceans whilst land based resources are depleting. 4.) All of us now have access to knowledge and insights about 70% of Planet Earth. We are empowered to protect the people, the environment and to develop solutions that provide needed resources. This is for us, our children and future generations to come. REALISE TODAY you can be part of making this happen. To all of you Earthlings ... a) collecting ocean data: You now can submit your ocean data collection into a shared ocean data knowledge platform. You are able to in return generate new revenue streams from an increasingly larger audience accessing your data. b) ... currently in need of ocean data: You soon can access the largest ocean data depository via a suite of underwater applications. You are able to outsource data and analysis at a fraction of your current costs. c) ... with a passion for marine geology, - biology, -chemistry, - physics: You now can join forces to solve one of the last mysteries on this planet - Demystifying the worlds ocean and ensuring a sustainable management of its resources for all Earthlings. d) ... with a passion for data science, artificial intelligence, statistical data analytics, software frontend - & backend development: You now can join forces to solve one of the last mysteries on this planet - Demystifying the worlds ocean and ensuring a sustainable management of its resources for all Earthlings.
